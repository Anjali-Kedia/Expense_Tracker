# Expense_Tracker

This is my first project made using MERN stack.

### Front-End 
The front-end of this project was built using React Hooks and Context API.
#### `What are React Hooks?`
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

#### `What is Context API?`
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
The API, creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching 
Provider above it in the tree.

### Back-end
The back-end was built using MongoDB Atlas and ExpressJS
